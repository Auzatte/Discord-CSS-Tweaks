Repository Description:

This repository hosts a curated collection of CSS tweaks sourced from the Vencord Discord community's #css-snippets channel. These styles enhance and customize the Discord client's visual experience, including guild navigation, panels, forms, and channel headers. All credit belongs to the original creators in the Vencord communityâ€”this project simply reorganizes their work into a cohesive, well-structured stylesheet for easier maintenance and readability.

Features:

Community-sourced UI/UX improvements

Organized code with logical grouping and comments

Preserved functionality with standardized formatting

Responsive design tweaks and visual consistency fixes

Note: This is a compilation/refactor project, not original work. Always attribute credit to the Vencord community members.
